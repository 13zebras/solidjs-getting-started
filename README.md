## Solid.js "Getting Started" Tutorial

A nice introduction to the unique patterns and primitives used with Solid. It isn't a radical departure from React, so most React devs should be able to pickup Solid easily. 

Solid.js is excellent to work with. The model is much easier to grasph than React, and there aren't 178 different hooks to learn. (Joking of course, React isn't that bad!)

Solid.js is definitely worth learning.
